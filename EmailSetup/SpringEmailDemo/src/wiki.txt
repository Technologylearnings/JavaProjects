The Teloschistaceae are a family of mostly lichen-forming fungi with a 
cosmopolitan distribution, mostly in temperate regions. Most either live on 
rock or on bark, and many are orange to yellow from anthraquinone which protects
them from ultraviolet light, enabling expansion into arid and sunny ecosystems.
They have a thallus that is leafy, bushy, or crusty, and partner with
photosynthetic Trebouxia algae. A 2013 revision recognised three subfamilies
and created or resurrected 31 more genera. Since then, many new genera have
been added and DNA studies are giving insights into relationships within
this family's more than 800 species and around 120 genera.
It remains underexplored in vast regions like South America and China.
Several rock-dwelling species are known to damage marble surfaces, and others are
used in some traditional medicines.
